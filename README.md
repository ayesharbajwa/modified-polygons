## Interactive Activity

In the land of Polynomia, shapes from different cities are classified into summer camps by an algorithm that is fed applicant information. We give an overview of training and deployment, then provide visualization tools to explore bias in and discuss fairness of the classification outcomes.

The activity is designed for grades 6-8 and based on [Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/) by Vi Hart and Nicky Case.

## Guiding Questions
How can a decision be unfair?

How are the outcomes of an automated decision affected by what we put in?

What are good strategies for detecting or measuring unfairness?

## Learning Objectives
Identifying ways in which bias can manifest in algorithm-based decisions.

Exploring how bias in algorithms may translate into consequences for users.

Understanding the importance of training data (which may be outdated, be significantly different from deployment data, include discriminatory features, etc).

The model is trained in-browser with [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).
